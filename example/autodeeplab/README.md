I just use tf2.0 for a quick implementation, and then transfer to pytorch.

## Planned Items

-[x] Network components (cells)

-[x] Network structures (connections)

-[x] Modify the network structure (Current one seems redundant)

-[x] Training code

-[ ] Low-level & High-level wrap-up

-[ ] Possible extensions
