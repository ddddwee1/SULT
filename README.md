# SUL
Self-use layers based on Tensorflow. Samples can be viewed in ./sample/

I am really looking forward to tf2.0, but still waiting. Even the BFV and Artifact is coming, there is no tf2.0. 

I'm waiting for totalwar 3kingdoms now. 

I start to reorganize my code for next year now. Its named sul2.0. 

#### SUL2.0
##### Features

- Replace layers with class-based structures.
- Reduce redundance
- Will be modified for both eager and graph. (graph is faster than eager)
