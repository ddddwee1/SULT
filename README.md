# SUL
Self-use layers based on Tensorflow. Samples can be viewed in ./sample/

I am really looking forward to tf2.0, but still waiting. Even the BFV and Artifact is coming, there is no tf2.0. 

Im waiting for totalwar 3kingdoms now. Last month is full of deadlines so I have no time for updating my codes.

I start to reorganize my code for next year now. Its named sul2.0. 

#### SUL2.0
##### Features

- Replace layers with class-based structures.
- Reduce redundance
- Will be modified for both eager and graph. (because graph is faster than eager)
