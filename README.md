# SUL
Self-use layers based on Tensorflow. Samples can be viewed in ./sample/

I am really looking forward to tf2.0, but still waiting. Even the BFV and Artifact has come, there is no tf2.0. I thought they will release in the end of 2018, but it is end of Jan. 2019 now.

I'm waiting for totalwar 3kingdoms now. Dont be late anymore, PLS!

#### SUL2.0
##### Introduction

Now the main model and layer is replaced by SUL2. SUL1 is moved into other folder. 

##### Features

- Replace layers with class-based structures.
- Reduce redundancy
- Modified for eager execution. It will be easier to use and more user-friendly.
- This is a light-weight wrap-up of tensorflow layers; therefore it will be convenient to touch the lower-level operations.
