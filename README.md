# SUL
Self-use layers based on Tensorflow. Samples can be viewed in ./sample/

TF2.0 IS COMING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I will update the model&layers several days later. 

Wait, wait... It's only alpha version

#### SUL2.0
##### Introduction

Now the main model and layer is replaced by SUL2. SUL1 is moved into './SUL1'. 

##### Features

- Replace layers with class-based structures.
- Reduce redundancy
- Modified for eager execution. It will be easier to use and more user-friendly.
- This is a light-weight wrap-up of tensorflow layers; therefore it will be convenient to touch the lower-level operations.
